JDBC-CRUD is a simple database application for universities that allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete student information. 

I built this to solidify concepts in my mind of how JSP and Servlet pages could work with SQL databases and how I could implement a Model-View-Controller architecture to an application. The CSS & JS are kept to a minimum (excuse the bare design here) and the focus was more about how different aspects of the MVC can communicate and interact with one another.

Credit of the original application idea goes to Chad Darby in his Udemy course, "JSP, Servlets, and JDBC for Beginners."
